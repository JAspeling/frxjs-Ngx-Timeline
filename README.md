# NgxTimeline

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.2.

## How to contribute
First of all, in order to track everything, open an issue describing the problem or a missing functionality you would like to add to the lib.

To start the contribution:
- `npm run watch-lib` (you are builduing the lib with --watch options)
- `npm run link` (you are linking the folder in your node modules in your machine to the dist folder containing the lib)
- `npm run link-lib` (you are linking the folder in the node modules used by the testing app to the lib)
- `npm run start` (you are serving the app)

Every time you will change the code in your lib, any udpdate will trigger the reload of the app.
When your code will be ready, create a Pull Request and put the link in a comment under the issue you opened before.
Now is time to enjoy and start to code.

Thanks in advance for your contribution
