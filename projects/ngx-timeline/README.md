## How to contribute
First of all, in order to track everything, open an issue describing the problem or a missing functionality you would like to add to the lib.

To start the contribution:
- `npm run watch-lib` (you are builduing the lib with --watch options)
- `npm run start-dev` (you are linking the lib and starting the demo app )

Every time you will change the code in your lib, any update will trigger the re-load of the app.
When your code will be ready, create a Pull Request and put the link in a comment under the issue you opened before.
Now is time to enjoy and start to code.

Thanks in advance for your contribution
